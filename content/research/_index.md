In Nature, organisms fabricate fascinating structures such as shells, bone, and teeth specifically designed to provide mechanical support and protection via biomineralisation. The materials such as calcium carbonate, iron oxides and manganese oxide to be made and investigated via biomimetic synthesis have potential industrial and biomedical applications.</td> <td><b>Luminescent Microporous Materials:<b> We will investigate the hydrothermal synthesis of phosphate and phosphite based inorganic-organic hybrid material with extra-large channels as well as distinctive photoluminescence property. Metal phosphates and phosphites with three-dimensional open-framework structures are of great technological importance (Financial support from CSIR)  </td> <td><b>MOFs and MWCNTs for storage of hydrogen (Clean Energy Applications):</b>Hydrogen is an energy carrier with great potential to become a major fuel for both mobile and stationary power generation. One major hurdle in using hydrogen on a commercial scale is the lack of cost effective, compact, and safe storage solutions. Therefore, the main objective of our proposal is to develop cost effective new hydrogen storage materials with the main focus on Metal-Organic Frameworks (Financial support from Centre for High Technology, Ministry of Petroleum & Natural gas in collaboration with HPCL, Mumbai)  </td>
