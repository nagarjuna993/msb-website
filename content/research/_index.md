<td>**Biomaterials - Nanomaterials**

In Nature, organisms fabricate fascinating structures such as shells, bone, and teeth specifically designed to provide mechanical support and protection via biomineralisation. The materials such as calcium carbonate, iron oxides and manganese oxide to be made and investigated via biomimetic synthesis have potential industrial and biomedical applications.</td>
